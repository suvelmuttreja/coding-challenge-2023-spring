# ACM Research coding challenge (Spring 2023)

For this challenge, I decided to predict the type of a star using the Star Dataset. Although this question is already provided as a suggestion in the coding challenge page, I want to continue with the given question and particularly predict star type because that star information seems the most useful to me. Understanding the type of a new star can provide a lot of new information about a star than the other value types (for example, most spectral classes contain multiple types of stars, providing little new information). For my comments on the rest of my project, including explanations of how and why I did what I did, please see the project. Thanks!
