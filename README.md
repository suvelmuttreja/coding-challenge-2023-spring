# ACM Research coding challenge (Spring 2023)

For this challenge, I decided to predict the type of a star using the Star Dataset. Although this question is already provided as a suggestion in the coding challenge page, I want to continue with the given question and particularly predict star type because that star information seems the most useful to me. Understanding the type of a new star can provide a lot of new information about a star than the other value types (for example, most spectral classes contain multiple types of stars, providing little new information). 

For my comments on the rest of my project, including explanations of how and why I did what I did, please see the project. 

For some reason, on my end, the notebook is cutting off. If that is also happening on your end, please visit https://www.kaggle.com/code/suvelmuttreja/star-data-preds to see all of my code and comments. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with and proud of my project. I was able to create a basic machine learning model and have it be perfectly accurate! I enjoyed working with real world data and learning how to process its imperfections to ensure compatibility with the model and generate correct results. It was a long process, but I feel satisfied because I believe that I have shown my current Python knowledge and skills through this project. 

If selected, I cannot wait to learn more about artificial intelligence and further improve my skills.

Thanks for reading!
